# `@nimblehq/eslint-config-nimble-core`

This package provides ESLint base rules

## Installation

```bash
  npm install --save-dev @nimblehq/eslint-config-nimble-core
```

## Usage

### Standalone

Add `@nimblehq/eslint-config-nimble-core` to the extends section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file.

```js
{
  "extends": [
      "@nimblehq/eslint-config-nimble-core"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // Additional, per-project rules...
  }
}
```

### With a framework

Similar to the process above, but usually it requires adding the extra rules for the JS framework:

```js
{
  "extends": [
      "@nimblehq/eslint-config-nimble-core",
      "plugin:react/recommended",
      "plugin:vue/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // Additional, per-project rules...
  }
}
```

This would require defining the required dependencies in the project itself.
